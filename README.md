This is a compiler and pasrser code built in JAVA , so the code will take input from the user and first do the lexical part (remove comments , remove white spaces , identify reserved wods delemetoes ..., error detection ) and then print the result in a file called output , for the praser part it will apply a specific grammer rule for (loops) and it will check the syntax and then print out the result in a file  , and also the symbol table will be printed in a file called output .


Please note ; this is a simple compiler code becasue developing a fully functional one need more resources and also become more complicated .
